Description:

IMPORTANT: 
  This project uses C++11, use gcc 4.7+ or clang 3.0+

To change the XML file and the animation:
  -Converted to JSON

The Specs that I implemented are:
  -Projectiles from the player
  -Collisions for the projectiles
  -Explosions
  -Sounds

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:
  none

Extras:
  -Gravity around planets in the world. Affects are based
    on all planets defined and their masses.

  -Chunk explosions implode first when exploding. 
    Best seen at low velocities

  -Sprites loose velocity when boucing off walls of the world
