Description:
  This program is theamed around zelda. All
  aspects of the animation can be configured
  with the xml file.

To change the XML file and the animation:
  Added parameters to:
    -set the max speed
    -set the range for the start speed
    -set acceleration for the sprite

The Specs that I implemented are:
  -add sprites to a vector
  -only use one surface for many sprites
  -move constants to xml file

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:
  none

Extras:
  -added acceleration to sprites
    -Acceleration is set to +/- randomly
     for both the x and y directions
  -added singleton random class to handle
    most random number generation.
  -Improved Makefile
    -Depenencies are generated automaticly
      by reading files.
    -Object file targets are created by
      reading files in dir.
    -Targets to specify compiler
    -Works on both Mac and Unix
    -Contains targets for building with
      the clang static analyzer and running
      valgrind
