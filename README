Description:
  This program is theamed around zelda. All
  aspects of the animation can be configured
  with the xml file.

To change the XML file and the animation:
  Added parameters to:
    -set the max speed
    -set the range for the start speed
    -set acceleration for the sprite
    -set the default frame rate cap

The Specs that I implemented are:
  -converted project to use the tracker framework
  -added multiframe and two way multiframe sprites
  -added a frame factory you make all frames
  -added help screen

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:
  none

Extras:
  -Improved Makefile
    -Added target to install the clang static analyzer on macs
    -added target to check code with cppcheck
  -I created all the sprites
  -Added frame rate cap
  -Changed the way the fps is calculated by using a deque.
